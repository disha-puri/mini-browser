A mini web-browser in java and corresponding tests in Junit

The browser has the following features
 * 1. Renders HTML elements including rich text (bold, italics, underline, etc) and images 
	(see JEditorPane in the Java API)
 * 2. Supports clicking on hyperlinks. 
	Clicking on the hyperlink will cause the browser to change the page contents to the location 
	specified in the hyperlink or display an error in a status bar
 * 3. The rendered HTML is not editable
 * 4. The browser has a forward and back button supporting browser history. 
 * The browser has a history.
 * 5. The browser shall has an address bar that shows the current URL. Note that this text can be manually edited.    Hitting the enter key will result in the browser attempting to load the URL in the address bar.
 * 6. The browser has a home button. Clicking this button will take users to http://www.google.com.
 * 7. The browser has a status bar showing error conditions (i.e. cannot load page, cannot parse URL, etc).
 * 8. The browser has a JFrame as its top level component. The JFrame's title shall be the same as specified in the <title> tag in the current page.
