* The folder contains the main file with top level component "JFrame" - browser.java.
* It calls MyPanel.java which extends JPanel as one of the components to be added in JFrame.
* The tests using Junit are in browserTest.java. They test the UI part of the browser.

- back and forward buttons are still disabled

3. Enter "http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~xie in the url-label. Press "Go" or hit enter (requirement - 5)
- Confirm that page displays the correct page 
	(requirement - 1,3. rendering of HTML and images is correct which is not editable)
- Title of the frame is "Fei Xie"
- Back button is now enabled.

4. Click on a hyperlink say publications.

5. Press back button to go to the last page. 
- Forward button should now enable. 

6. Press forward to come to current page. (requirement - 4)
